Prisma Migrate Dev is a command used for database schema migrations.
It allows developers to make changes to their database schema and
generate migration scripts that can be executed to update the
database schema. This command creates a development environment
that automatically watches for changes in the Prisma schema file
and applies the necessary migrations when changes are detected.

Prisma Generate is a command used to generate Prisma client code.
This command reads the Prisma schema file and generates TypeScript
code that can be used to interact with the database. This generated
code includes functions to create, read, update, and delete data
from the database. By running this command, developers can generate
updated code whenever changes are made to the Prisma schema file.
